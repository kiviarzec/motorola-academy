# motorola-academy

Hello,

Thanks for oppoturnity to check myself in that hangman task. Now few words about why am I applying to your academy.
I used to learn how to code during my studies time long time ago. 
I've stoped it because of lack of time, but I've always did like maths and logic tasks. 
I have just made a decision to change my career path and programming seems to be right way 
to go given my past interests and number of personal development opportunities which this sector has to offer.

Best regards,
Krzysiek
